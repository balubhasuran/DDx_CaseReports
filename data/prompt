{Symptoms:Flu-like symptoms 10 days before the onset of icterus, suffered from gradual fatigue and weakness with dark urine }
{Case Report: A 30-year-old man with icterus was referred to emergency center of Razi Hospital. There was no history of disease, smoking, or drug abuse. He stated to have flu-like symptoms 10 days before the onset of icterus, which was treated as an outpatient. Also, he suffered from gradual fatigue and weakness with dark urine. Then he was referred to the Department of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases of Razi Hospital for admission. In addition, the patient declared nausea, fever, and chills, which had improved over the previous 2 days, while the icterus still remained. There was no history of disease among him and his family. He reported a history of appendectomy 15 years earlier. His initial blood test showed high levels of liver function enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia as well as high C-reactive protein (CRP) (table1). Also, table 2 shows the results of urine analysis. On the second day of admission, he experienced neurological symptoms of muscle paralysis (ascending from the legs to hands). Neurological consultant suspected GBS based on clinical examinations. The patient was scheduled for five sessions of plasmapheresis for the first step because in any situations of GBS suspicion, treatment is vital. According to the imaging evaluations such as ultrasonography, the liver span was 166 mm, which was greater than the normal range, with normal parenchymal echo. Intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts were normal. The gallbladder wall was thicker than normal and gallstone with lesion was not seen in different locations.

{Case Report: "Clinical course A 6-year-old boy presented to our Emergency Department with a 3-week history of an erythematous papulovesicular itchy eruption over the submandibular regions,trunk, and extremities. His overall condition was fne; no fever or constitutional symptoms were recorded. Tere was no clear precipitating factor, including infections, the use of drugs, vaccines, or food allergies. Past medical and family history were unremarkable. }
{Lab tests: "Laboratory tests, including the complete blood count (white blood cells 5.4× 109 /L with 27.5% neutrophils and 47.9% lymphocytes, hemoglobin 12.2  g/dl, and platelet 323.000/mmc), serum electrolytes, glucose, kidney and liver function, C-reactive protein, coagulation parameters, and standard urinalysis were normal. SARS-CoV-2 antigen detecting test from a nasopharyngeal swab was negative. Complete blood count, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine kinase, and urinalysis were persistently within reference limits. A normal level of plasma amino acid was also documented. High level of C-reactive protein (34.8  mg/dl, normal≤10) aspartate aminotransferase (102 U/L, normal 11–34), alanine transaminase (93 U/L, normal≤49) and bilirubin (total 1.35 mg/dl, normal<1.2; direct 0.53 mg/dl, normal≤0.3) were instead recorded. Immunohistochemistry showed an activated, CD8+cytotoxic, partially defective T-cell phenotype (CD2-/+, CD3+, CD5-, CD7-/+, CD4-, CD8+, perforin+, CD56-, TCRdelta-), with moderate to intense CD30-positivity on 60–70% of the cells (Fig.  2). Polymerase chain reaction for T-cell receptor gamma (TCRG) chain clonality assessment, according to BIOMED-2 guidelines, documented a monoclonal peak. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-4-6-10, and interferon (IFN)-γ were measured on admission by using commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (R&D system ELISA kit). Compared to age-matched controls, elevated levels of IL-6 (130 pg/ml; control values 23 ± 16), IL-10 (18 pg/ml; control values 6.6 ± 6.6), and IFN-γ (318 pg/ ml; control values < 0.1were recorded. IL-4 and TNF-α were below the detection limit (< 0.1 pg/ml), as in controls."  }

{Symptoms: Jaundice and dark-colored urine for three days, associated with pale-colored stools }
{Case Report: "A 27-year-old woman with no known past medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) on account of jaundice and dark-colored urine for three days, associated with pale-colored stools. She is originally from Barbados and frequently travels to the US. Two weeks prior to this presentation, she was in Barbados. One week before her presentation, she returned from a carnival in Miami, Florida. She participated in face painting during her trip. She denied fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, sick contacts, pruritus, or rash. She had no past surgical history, history of allergies, or family history of jaundice or liver disease. She had never smoked or used illicit drugs and only drank alcohol during social gatherings. Her last sexual contact was six months ago with a male partner. Physical examination revealed no other stigmata of chronic liver disease except 3+ bilateral conjunctival icterus. She had no abdominal tenderness, distention, organomegaly, edema, or asterixis. Laboratory evaluation revealed a mixed hepatocellular, cholestatic jaundice. }
{Lab tests: "Her transaminases were markedly elevated with alanine transaminase (ALT) of 1287U/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 1057U/L. Her alkaline phosphatase (ALP), however, was only slightly above normal at 109U/L (normal range 35-104 U/L) with a gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) elevated to 220U/L (normal range 5-40 U/L). She had mostly direct hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 9.5mg/dl (normal range 0.1-1.2mg/dl) and direct bilirubin of 6.8mg/dl (normal range 0.1-0.3mg/dl). Her international normalized ratio (INR) was slightly prolonged at 1.29. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.88, platelet count of 339, with normal differentials (neutrophils 48.8%, lymphocytes 37.9%, monocytes 9.5%, eosinophils 2.9% and basophils 0.5%). She was anemic with a hemoglobin of 10.4, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 66.2, and red cell distribution width (RDW) of 16.9. Iron studies showed elevated iron 200, normal unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) 136, normal total iron binding capacity (TIBC) 336, elevated transferrin saturation of 59%, and ferritin of 459ug/L. Her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 415U/L (normal range 125-220U/L). Hemoglobin electrophoresis was consistent with beta-thalassemia minor. A direct Coombs test to check for hemolytic anemia came back negative; however, her haptoglobin level was < 20. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal hepatic echogenicity and no dilated intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts. The cause of her jaundice was thought to be intrahepatic, so viral studies were sent for hepatitis A, B, and C, which all came back negative. Ceruloplasmin level to screen for Wilson’s disease also came back normal, as did anti-smooth muscle antibodies, anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and antimitochondrial antibodies to rule out autoimmune liver disease. Given the height of her transaminase elevations, the patient was again queried about toxin ingestion. She denied cocaine or other drugs, and her lead level was normal. The endemicity of malaria in Barbados was considered, and testing for the malaria parasite was performed and found to be negative. She was then evaluated for possible acute EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Further laboratory evaluation revealed negative CMV immunoglobulin M (IgM). Her Epstein-Barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid (EBV DNA) was undetectable while her EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin G (IgG), EBV early antigen (EA) antibody (Ab) enzyme immunoassay (EIA), EpsteinBarr nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG EIA, and EBNA IgG came back with high titers (Table 1). EBV VCA IgM 12.7 <35.9 U/ml Negative EBV VCA IgG >750.0 <17.9 U/ml Positive EBV EA Ab EIA 15.8 <8.9 U/ml Positive EBNA IgG EIA 114 <17.9 U/ml Positive"  }

{Symptoms: Remission of cytomegalovirus. Abdominal pain, diarrhea,  nausea, and vomiting. Contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 month before admission. }
{Case Report: "On 27 December 2020, an 18-year-old young Iranian adult with a history of ALL who had been undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for more than 18 months and was in remission was admitted to our hospital owing to abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. He has a history of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 month before admission and subsequently repeated hospitalization. Te patient never developed respiratory symptoms and did not fulfll the criteria for remdesivir treatment on frst-time detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) test. Te patient chemotherapy regimen consists of monthly vincristine (1.5 mg/m2 ), prednisolone (40 mg/m2 ) 5 days per month, weekly methotrexate (10 mg/m2 ), and 6-mercaptopurine (50 mg) every night. He also received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 400/80  mg twice per day/three times per week for Pneumocystis  jirovecii prophylaxis and voriconazole (VCZ) 200  mg twice per day concurrent with his chemotherapy. He has a history of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and pan-sinusitis (8 and 4 weeks before admission, respectively). He was hospitalized with severe GI signs and symptoms in another academic hospital (leading to intensive care unit admission) without clinical improvement, leading to self-discharge. On admission, he was febrile (tympanic temperature 38.8  °C). He sufered from nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, oral aphthous lesions, skin rashes, excessive drooling, low appetite, weight loss, and decreased urine output. Te results of his primary lab testing are summarized in Table 1. On the basis of presenting signs and symptoms, severe abnormal liver function tests, and prerenal azotemia, we considered several diferential diagnoses, including sepsis, drug–drug interactions or toxicities [methotrexate (MTX), vincristine (VNC), VCZ], SARS-CoV-2-induced gastroenteritis, biliary obstruction, portal venous thrombosis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection or VNC-induced veno-occlusive disease (VOD), and, fnally, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TAGVHD), given the history of the repeated transfusion (especially non-irradiated blood transfusion). Accordingly, he was worked up for drug–drug interactions. No signifcant interaction was found except VCZ/VNC. VCZ was withheld and VCZ serum levels were checked for three consecutive days, and all were within therapeutic or subtherapeutic ranges, 0.329 µg/mL, 0.241 µg/mL, and 0.526 µg/mL, respectively. MTX serum level also was checked, which was not in the toxic range (<0.1 µmol/L), CYP2C19A polymorphism was also checked, which was compatible with homozygote CYP2C19*17 alleles (ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype). Serum galactomannan was negative on two occasions [0.3 and 0.2 optical density index (ODI)]. Given the prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), a mixing test was requested. Te mixing test corrected PT, PTT, and INR values in about 2  h. Factor assay was also performed, which showed decreased factor II and X levels, with acceptable factor V levels. On abdominopelvic ultrasonographic (US) study, the liver was normal in size with diffusely increased parenchymal echogenicity compatible with fatty liver change grade 2. Color Doppler sonography (CDS) of mesenteric and portal veins was done to investigate chemotherapy-induced VOD, which was normal. When leukemia was diagnosed, the patient’s primary investigations revealed that he was CMV seropositive. Accordingly, a CMV blood PCR test was performed to check for CMV reactivation. Te high viral load [98,500 copies/mL; cycle threshold (CT) 29] was suggestive of a signifcant CMV viremia. Stool was assessed for CMV by PCR because of hepatic impairment (abnormal liver function tests) and GI signs and symptoms. A fecal sample showed extremely high viral shedding (295,480,000 copies/mL; CT: 25). So, the patient was investigated for the possibility of disseminated CMV disease, including CMV encephalitis, despite having no central nervous system (CNS) signs or symptoms due to concurrent CMV viremia and CMV enteritis. CMV was not detected by PCR in CSF and urine specimens. We also investigated SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and stool PCR. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and stool RT–PCR also were positive (CT 31 and 24, respectively) for the Alpha strain. B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P1 (Gamma) variant’s single-nucleotide deletions were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 by a multiplex PCR using type-specifc probes described by Vogels et al. (Additional fle 1, Molecular Analysis for SARS-CoV-2 Variants Identifcation) [27]. A summary of viral marker test results is presented in Table 1. Te patient’s clinical course timeline and key clinical events during repeated hospitalization are shown in Fig. 1. Te results of his virologic investigation are summarized in Table  2. Figure  2 also illustrates the patient’s SARS-CoV-2 status compared with the national data of transmission peaks. Te patient was treated with intravenous ganciclovir (5  mg/kg/dose Q12  hours as a loading dose) on 29 December 2020 once blood and stool CMV PCR confrmed CMV reactivation. Intragastrointestinal CMV replication was suppressed signifcantly after 1  week of ganciclovir treatment (stool PCR 20,800 copies/mL with CT 31.5). Blood viral load also decreased gradually up to the low level of detection (97,850, 1200, and 560 copies/ mL) on repeated testing. Stool CMV PCR was negative (nondetectable) on follow-up testing in the sixth and seventh weeks of treatment. Te patient’s treatment course was continued with oral valganciclovir 450 mg Q12 hours for 4  weeks. He had, however, experienced intermittent GI symptoms for several weeks following that, leading to recurrent hospitalizations. He received a short course of intravenous rehydration therapy (3–7  days) and supplementary electrolytes for correcting hypokalemia and hyponatremia in each admission. On 21 April 2021, a diagnostic rectosigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were carried out, and several biopsies from the right colon, terminal ileum, and rectum were taken. No macroscopic or microscopic abnormality was detected during the operation and immunohistopathologic evaluation. It should be noted that diagnostic rectosigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were postponed several times due to severe coagulopathy, profound neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, in addition to the patient’s self-discharge events from the hospital. CMV was detected by PCR in all tissue samples. SARSCoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and original wild-type SARS-CoV-2 were also found in all three specimens. No specifc CMV-cytopathic changes were reported on immunohistopathologic examination (Fig.  3a–d). Te SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal test was also positive for the Wuhan strain (CT 28). On 8 May 2021, the patient was treated with intravenous remdesivir (200  mg as a loading dose and 100 mg daily for 4 days) despite having no respiratory signs or symptoms. All GI manifestations resolved a few days after antiviral treatment, and he was encouraged to undergo close follow-up monitoring. Finally, the patient was admitted again on 27 July, with febrile neutropenia and decreased level of consciousness necessitating respiratory support and mechanical ventilation. Te patient’s nasopharyngeal specimen tested positive again, and blood and stool CMV PCR also were positive (30,500 and 19,700 copies/mL, respectively). Te patient’s chest X-rays revealed bilateral multifocal parenchymal involvement (Fig.  4). Te patient died after cardiopulmonary arrest on 27 July 2021. We also perform immunological workups during the two periods of patient admissions, as shown in Fig.  5 (including the last two admissions where the second was 1 day before the patient died). Te patient experienced severe neutropenia in both periods. Analysis of the serum cytokines revealed a similar pattern on two occasions; however, a substantial increase in IL-6 was found during the last admission (2593.5 versus 38  pg/ mL) 1 day before the patient died. At this time, IL-17A and IL-17F decreased signifcantly to the nondetectable values. Analysis of the last lymphocyte immunophenotyping showed that the frequency of CD3+ CD4+ T cells was high (92%), whereas the levels of CD3− CD16+ CD56+ lymphocytes (natural killer cells) as well as B lymphocytes (CD3− CD19+ CD20+) were low (2% and 6%, respectively).

{Case Report: "A 52-year-old male presented to our institution’s emergency department with a three-day history of melena. This is with a background of night sweats and 8 kg unintentional weight loss over the preceding 6 months. His past medical history included excess alcohol intake, chronic liver cirrhosis (Childs Pugh B), asthma and smoking. Further history revealed long term non-steroidal anti-inf lammatory use. There were no previous endoscopic investigations or surgical history. The patient underwent an emergency laparotomy. Intraoperatively large varices supplying the ascending colon and caecum were noted. A right hemicolectomy was performed with stapled bowel ends left in situ, and the administration of an abdominal vacuum dressing. The resected bowel specimen was opened on back-table where an isolated dilated varix opening into the caecum was observed to cause intraluminal bleeding. The patient was then transferred to intensive care. A further laparotomy was performed 2 days later, where extensive oedema in the abdominal wall and bowel was noted. An end ileostomy was performed due to the high likelihood of decompensation and limited patient life expectancy. The post-operative course was complicated with bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome and the patient remained in intensive care for the majority of his inpatient stay. He undergoes follow-up with gastroenterology and renal teams."   }
{Lab tests: "On initial presentation, the patient’s vitals consisted of a blood pressure of 98/44 mmHg and a heart rate of 93 bpm. Phlebotomy revealed an anaemia (haemoglobin 62 g/L) in the setting of liver function derangement (gamma-glutamyl transferase 251 U/L, alanine transaminase 40 U/L, bilirubin 84 umol/L, alkaline phosphatase 85 U/L), coagulopathy (International Normalized Ratio 1.6) and acute kidney injury (creatinine 285 umol/L). On gastroscopy, neither bleeding sources nor features of portal hypertension were identified. Subsequently, a large volume rectal haemorrhage occurred, resulting in severe hypotension and syncope. The patient was resuscitated appropriately and received a massive transfusion protocol. A CT angiogram revealed focal clustered varices travelling retroperitoneally abutting the caecal pole (Fig. 1), which communicated with a large branch of SMV in the right iliac fossa."  }

Now: weakness, lightheadedness and dizziness on standing that affects his daily activities. He reports lancinating pain in his right lower extremity, worse in the evening.}
{Case Report: A 64-year-old male with a 15-year history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and a 10-year history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia had developed multiple diabetes-related complications within the last 5 years. He first developed albuminuria 5 years ago, and over the next several years experienced fairly rapid decline in kidney function, with eGFR of 55 mL/min/1.73m2 noted 2 years ago. He was diagnosed with proliferative retinopathy 5 years ago and underwent laser photocoagulation. Four years ago, he noted symptoms of peripheral neuropathy manifested as shooting pain and numbness with loss of light touch, thermal and vibratory sensation in a stocking distribution. Last year he developed a non-healing ulcer on the plantar aspect of his left foot which was complicated with gangrene and resulted in a below-the-knee amputation of the left leg one year ago.

{Case Report: "A 61 year old Caucasian male of European ancestry presented with marked HDL deficiency. He had a long standing history of coronary artery disease initially diagnosed at age 42 years when he developed angina, and at that time had an angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery. At age 52 years he developed recurrent angina and subsequently underwent coronary artery bypass surgery grafting surgery of his right, circumflex, left anterior descending coronary arteries. He also had a history of hypertension, past cigarette smoking (quit at age 41 years), and peripheral arterial disease. His father died at age 69 years of colon cancer, and his mother was alive at age 88 years, with a history of hypertension and stroke, and reportedly normal lipid levels. His parents were unrelated, so there was no evidence of consanguinity. He had 4 siblings. One sister died at age 49 years of breast cancer. One brother died at age 48 years of a cerebral artery aneurysm. One brother died at age 51 years of a drug overdose. One brother was alive and well at age 52 years, with no history of CHD, with normal lipids, but with an HDL-C value in the 30 mg/dl range. The patient’s wife was in good health. He had two offspring, a daughter age 31 years in good health with normal lipids and an HDL-C of 62 mg/dl, and a son, age 36 years in good health, with unknown lipid levels. The patient declined to have his family members studied. At the time of his examination in our clinic he was on the following medications: aspirin 81 mg/day, extended release diltiazem 120 mg/day, extended release niacin 2 grams/day, ezetimibe 10 mg/day, fenofibrate 145 mg/day, fish oil 1 g/day, isosorbide 10 mg three times daily, metoprolol 25 mg three times/day, and rosuvastatin 40 mg/day. A physical examination revealed: height 71 inches, weight 231 pounds, blood pressure 140/99 mmHg, and heart rate 66/minute. His eye examination revealed significant circular arcus senilis. However in contrast to the arcus observed with aging or familial hypercholesterolemia, in this patient there was no space between the arcus and the limbus. The arcus was previously observed for some time by his referring physician, but it is unclear precisely at what age it developed. He had normal heart and lung examinations. The pulses in his legs (popliteals, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial) were present, but were significantly diminished bilaterally. He had no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or xanthomas. Blood was drawn after an overnight fast for laboratory analysis." }
{Lab tests: "Total cholesterol 112 mg/dl (normal), triglyceride 447 mg/dl (elevated), HDL-C < 5 mg/dl (very low), and LDL-C 77 mg/dl (close to optimal), and lipoprotein (a) 25 nmol/L (normal).

{Symptoms:Hypertriglyceridemia. Nonsmoker, non-alcoholic, reasonable diet with abundant fruits and vegetables, and exercises regularly.  }
{Case Report: A 40-year-old healthy man, who came for a routine screening in our diagnostic laboratory at Barasat dated 19.11.2010, was diagnosed having hypertriglyceridemia. On interrogation, he was found to be a nonsmoker, non- alcoholic, reasonable diet with abundant fruits and vegetables, and exercises regularly. He has not been taking any lipid lowering medications. He works in a government sector in Barasat and policeman by profession. His father Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as an abnormal concentration of triglyceride in the blood and has been associated with atherosclerosis, even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia. This case report is of 40-year-old man diagnosed to have hypertriglyceridemia who attended for routine screening in our diagnostic laboratory at Barasat. He was nonsmoker, non-alcoholic, had a reasonable diet with abundant fruits and vegetables, and was on regular exercise. He was not taking any lipid lowering medications. He hailed from Barasat, and was employed in Government sector in Barasat and policeman by profession. His father died at the age of 57 years in a heart attack; but his mother is healthy and now almost 62 years of age, and he has two brothers one elder and another younger to him, both are healthy. His blood pressure was normal, his body-mass index was 27, and his waist circumference was 96 cm and hip circumference was 103. His waist/hip ratio was 0.932.  This study revealed the increased prevalence of dyslipidemia to be more prevalent in 31-40 year males, suggesting that this group is at an increased risk of developing CAD leading to young infarcts. Combination lifestyle therapies i.e., enhanced physical activity and dietary modification and therapeutic intervention would help us in the treatment and management of dyslipidemia. died at the age of 57 years in a heart attack; but his mother is healthy and now almost 62 years of age, and he has two brothers one elder and another younger to him, both are healthy. His blood pressure was normal, his body-mass index was 27, and his waist circumference was 96 cm and hip circumference was 103. His waist/hip ratio was 0.932. For lipid profile analysis twelve hours fasting blood samples were collected from the subject in our laboratory at Barasat. Five mL of blood samples was collected in a sterile test tube, allowed to clot and then carefully centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m for 10 minutes. Clear serum was used for analysis of lipid profile. The total cholesterol, triglyceride and high- density lipoprotein were analyzed enzymatically using kit obtained from Randox Laboratories Limited, Crumlin, UK. Plasma LDL-cholesterol was determined from the values of total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol using the following formula}
{Lab tests: Fasting glucose: 186 mg/dL, total cholesterol: 90 mg/dL, Triglycerides: 372 mg/dL, High-density cholesterol: 3.80 mg/ dL, Low-density cholesterol: 2.90 mg/dL, VLDL: 83.20 mg/dL, Cholesterol/HDL-C ratio: 23.6:1, LDL-C/HDL-C: 0.07:1. The biochemical investigations were repeated after one week and the following results were obtained: Fasting glucose: 179 mg/dL, total cholesterol: 83 mg/dL, Triglycerides: 364 mg/dL, High-density cholesterol: 3.70 mg/ dL, Low-density cholesterol: 3.10 mg/dL, VLDL: 82.24 mg/dL, Cholesterol/HDL-C ratio: 22.43:1, LDL-C/HDL-C: 0.84:1. }

{Case Report: A 61-year-old man from Jamaica with wellcontrolled HIV (CD4 count 343/mL, viral load 220 copies/mL) on treatment with highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) with tenofovir, emtricitabine, darunavir and ritonavir presented with fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and jaundice for 1 month. Examination was unremarkable except for jaundice.  Workup including autoimmune disease markers, hereditary hepatopathies and toxicology screen did not reveal any abnormality. Given that liver function tests did not improve after cessation of HAART, HAART was restarted 2 months later. Repeated CT scan was unyielding. Five months after the initial presentation, MRI of the abdomen was performed which revealed para-iliac and para-aortic lymph nodes and several small liver cysts without any evidence of obstruction, findings which were attributed to AIDS. The patient was now experiencing daily fevers which did not improve with empirical antibiotics and severe progressive weakness with worsening performance status. 
 }
{Lab tests: "Investigations showed deranged liver function with alkaline phosphatase 2639 U/L, total bilirubin 6.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 5.1 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase 219 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 352 U/L and lactate dehydrogenase 319 U/L. Workup including autoimmune disease markers, hereditary hepatopathies and toxicology screen did not reveal any abnormality. Viral serology was positive for EBV early antigen and IgG, with negative IgM. An initial CT imaging was unyielding, except for lymphadenopathy which was attributed to AIDS. a liver biopsy was performed which revealed large atypical neoplastic cells especially in the periportal areas, with Reed Sternberg cells, focal inflammatory infiltrates and granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Pathology interpretation of the liver biopsy was classical Hodgkins lymphoma with CD30, MUM-1, Ki-67, PAX-5 positive and CD10, CD23, BCL-2, CMV, AE1/AE3, EBER negative. T cells were positive for CD3, CD5 and CD43. Rare cells were positive for CD20. Patient’s ferritin level was checked and was found to be elevated at 45 367 mg/L."  }

{Symptoms: Past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who presented with new-onset painless jaundice. }
{Case Report: "We report a case of a 68-year-old Caucasian man (90 kg, 177.8 cm, BMI 28.47) with a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who presented with new-onset painless jaundice. The patient had recently been hospitalized for treatment of L3/L4 osteomyelitis secondary to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. He was treated with intravenous nafcillin, 2 g every 4 h, as an inpatient and was continuing treatment as an outpatient. The patient had been on antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks at the time of presentation. The patient reported that his skin had turned yellow, his urine had grown darker, and his stools had turned grey over a course of 5 days. He also suffered a 20-lb weight loss over a 3-week period prior to presentation. The patient denied abdominal pain, fever/chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sick contacts. The patient further denied any use of alcohol, illicit drugs, herbal supplements, or any new medications except nafcillin. On presentation, the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Physical exam revealed intact mentation, scleral and sublingual icterus, trace asterixis, jaundiced skin tone, normal bowel sounds, no abdominal tenderness, and no hepatomegaly.  The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22, with 19.6% estimated 3-month mortality. Eosinophils were elevated to 20.7% of blood leukocytes. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis at the time of initiation of nafcillin therapy on the previous admission revealed a normal-sized liver, an unremarkable gallbladder, no biliary ductal dilation, and no pancreatic lesions. On this admission, a right upper quadrant ultra-sound did not identify stones, sludge, or biliary pathology. Further imaging study with an MRCP showed an unremarkable pancreatobiliary tree, no focal lesions in the liver, and no intrahepatic/extrahepatic biliary dilatation. All serology and titers were unremarkable (online suppl. Table 1, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000480071). Lactulose was started as a preventive measure against encephalopathy and empiric intravenous N-acetylcysteine was administered. Nafcillin was discontinued on admission and the patient was transitioned to intravenous vancomycin for further treatment of the osteomyelitis given the concern for DILI-ALF.  }
{Lab tests: "Lab work revealed total bilirubin/direct bilirubin 9.4/8.2 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase of 311 IU/L; aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase 109/127 IU/L; INR 1.6; ammonia level 17 μmol/L; and acetaminophen level. Hepatic workup included viral hepatitis serology (genotype A, B, and C), antimitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, total immunoglobulin levels, anti-LK microsomal antibodies, iron studies, and ceruloplasmin levels. All serology and titers were unremarkable.The patient underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy. Pathology revealed findings consistent with cholestatic hepatitis. Liver enzymes trended upwards and peaked at AST/ALT 313/190 IU/L on day 7 of admission (Fig. 1). Total/direct bilirubin peaked at 13.1/11.6 mg/dL on day 4 of admission (Fig. 2). A diagnosis of nafcillin-induced acute liver injury was made. The patient was discharged 10 days after admission with outpatient gastroenterology follow up for further evaluation. Transaminases, bilirubin levels, and the INR decreased to baseline levels with complete resolution of the jaundice at the time of follow up 2 weeks after discharge. The MELD score improved to 17, with 6.0% estimated 3-month mortality." "}

No rash, petechiae, ecchymoses, oral lesions, or lymphadenopathy was found. The arms revealed no abnormalities and the legs were normal. Neurological examination was normal. The patient was treated with an incremental dose of extended-release nicotinic acid but his HDL remained low. The secondary causes of low HDL-C levels such as the use of androgens, progestins, cigarette smoking, obesity, low-fat diet, and drugs like beta-blockers were ruled out. This leads us to consider the less well-known but well-documented fact that monoclonal gammopathies have unusual specificity for apolipoprotein, and paraproteins may interfere with the measurement of HDL-C in some automated analyzers. To confirm our hypothesis we performed serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, which showed IgG 720 mg/dl (576-1782), IgA 116 mg/dl ( 59-484) and an abnormally high IgM at 3510 mg/dl (57-266). Bone marrow biopsy showed a paratrabecular and intertrabecular infiltrates of small noncleaved lymphocytes. Immunohistochemical studies showed B cell phenotype (CD 45, CD20 positive, and negative CD 3 and CD 10) consistent with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. He is being followed conservatively by hematology as has been stable thus far."  }

{Case Report: "A 44 year old man was admitted to our hospital because of generalized convulsion. His history included treatment for a brain contusion that occurred due to a traffic accident 20 years ago, and since then, valproic acid has been administrated following a diagnosis of symptomatic epilepsy. Head computed tomography on admission showed no newly detected lesions. LEV administration was stopped, and he was conservatively treated with monoammonium glycyrrhizinate, glycine L cysteine hydrochloride hydrate, and intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer’s solution. His laboratory values at 12 h after drug withdrawal were as follows: ALT, 1,192 IU/L; AST, 3,150 IU/L; and total bilirubin, 2.02 mg/dl. With additional time, they gradually decreased even further toward the normal range [Figure 1]. At this point, to confirm whether LEV was responsible for the patient’s acute liver injury, a drug induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) (SRL, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was performed (a stimulation index of 180% or greater is considered to indicate a positive response). The results indicated a positive response with respect to LEV, with a stimulation index of 300%. In light of these findings, it was determined that LEV could not be readministrated in this patient, and lacosamide was instead chosen.

{Case Report: "A 79-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of lumbar stenosis (status post lumbar laminectomy two months back, complicated by surgical site infection), gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, presented to the hospital six weeks post-surgery with complaints of right upper quadrant pain, intense pruritis and jaundice of one-week duration. She was on prolonged antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime for six weeks for lumbar wound infection, both the medicines were stopped a week prior to the hospital visit due to worsening renal function. Her vitals were temperate of 37ºC, pulse of 94/minute, blood pressure of 92/46 mm of Hg, and respiratory rate of 14/minute. She was treated supportively with fluids and continued on vancomycin, as she met systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Her vitals stabilized on day seven of hospital stay. Investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 8.4 gm/dL, white blood cell count of 30.4 K/uL, ALP of 2003 U/L, AST of 686 U/L, ALT of 971 U/L, total bilirubin of 22.2 mg/dl, BUN of 87 mg/dl, creatinine of 3.5 mg/dl, and eGFR of 11 ml/min. The trends of liver function tests and renal function tests are shown in Figures 3 and Figure 4, respectively.Given her recent antibiotic use, maculopapular rash, and eosinophilia in the setting of multiorgan failure, the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made. As per the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Criteria (RegiSCAR) [9], the probability of vancomycininduced DRESS syndrome was scored as “Definite.” Vancomycin was stopped, and she was started on high dose steroids (IV methylprednisolone 40 mg 8-hourly (0.5-2 mg/kg)) and Nacetylcysteine. The patient initially responded to steroids as indicated by an improvement in renal function, eventually developing progressive hepatic failure. Given the acuity of her condition, a renal biopsy was not indicated. She was not a good candidate for liver transplant given her age and comorbidities. She was sent to a long-term acute care facility with a plan of tapering steroids for 12 weeks. She eventually passed away due to multi-organ failure" }
{Lab tests: " On examination, she had scleral icterus, diffuse maculopapular rash, right upper quadrant tenderness, a positive Murphy’s sign, and generalized edema. Her investigations revealed a hemoglobin of 10.5 gm/dL, white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, peripheral eosinophil count of 1730 K/uL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 2742 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) of 612 U/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) of 674 U/L, total bilirubin of 14.2 mg/dl with a direct component of 9.5mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 64 mg/dl, creatinine of 5.01 mg/dl (with a baseline creatinine of 0.61 mg/dl), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 8 ml/min, and a vancomycin trough level of 10.8 mcg/ml. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis with positive sonographic Murphy’s sign (Figure 1), computed tomography of the abdomen without contrast showed cholelithiasis with no inflammation and a common biliary duct of 4 mm in diameter (Figure 2). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography was negative for obstruction. " }

{Case Report: A 56-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of hypertension and fibromyalgia presented to the outpatient clinic for the evaluation of fatigue. She reported that she had been following a strict ketogenic diet along with daily regular exercise for approximately 30-40 days prior to this visit. Her diet consisted of low-carbohydrate vegetables, seafood, avocados, eggs, and coconut oil. The patient’s physical examination was unremarkable. She was instructed to stop the ketogenic diet and to incorporate a balanced diet, which includes a higher amount of carbohydrates and lower fat. She was also started on high-intensity atorvastatin. However, she reported experiencing myalgias soon after initiating atorvastatin; therefore, the medication was switched to rosuvastatin 10 mg at bedtime. During her follow-up appointment, she reported not having consistently taken rosuvastatin due to concerns of worsening myalgias. CPK levels were reordered and found to be unchanged. Furthermore, she denied prominent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness during this follow-up appointment; hence, statin-induced myopathy was ruled out. Her lipid profile, after four weeks of ketogenic diet discontinuation and inconsistent use of statins, showed a significant improvement resulting in a total cholesterol level of 190 mg/dl and LDL-C of 106 mg/dl. Statin therapy was discontinued, and the patient maintained optimal LDL-C levels on subsequent testing.
}
{Lab tests: At the time of the visit, her BMI was calculated at 28 kg/m2 , with a weight loss of approximately six to seven pounds since starting the ketogenic diet. Her fasting lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 283 mg/dl, LDL-C of 199 mg/dl, HDL-C of 59 mg/dl, and triglyceride level of 124 mg/dl. Her creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was 94 U/l.}

{Case Report: Our patient is a 33-year-old Honduran female with poorly-controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1c of 9.5% to 11%), diagnosed at the age of 8, requiring multiple hospitalizations secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with findings of elevated aminotransferases [4]. Her medical history is notable for severe gastroparesis, requiring endoscopic botox injections, recurrent pancreatitis of unknown etiology, and hypothyroidism. Her surgical history was significant for cholecystectomy done in her mid-20s. In terms of her social history, she had denied any alcohol use, smoking, or usage of any recreational drugs. There was no known family history of any gastrointestinal pathology. At the age of 25, the patient had initially presented with dyspepsia, early satiety, and diarrhea that required her to obtain an endoscopy demonstrating gastritis but with no other abnormal findings otherwise. During that time, she required a five-day hospital stay due to noted abnormal liver tests that were attributed to gastroenteritis at that time, as the patient had no history of alcohol abuse, no evidence of cholelithiasis, and a negative hepatitis panel. Finally, after exhausting some of these diagnostic tests, our patient was sent for a liver biopsy for further evaluation and to definitively rule out an autoimmune cause for her condition. The liver biopsy, however, demonstrated glycogenotic hepatocytes with the patient subsequently being diagnosed with GH. Subsequent hospitalizations were due to abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting secondary to gastroparesis and chronic pancreatitis. She continued to frequently obtain endoscopic Botox injections for her gastroparesis, as well as celiac plexus block for the alleviation of her pain due to pancreatitis. Her blood glucose levels remained better controlled during these later hospitalizations, with less frequent hypoglycemic episodes, which was reflected on her liver tests that appeared mildly elevated to almost normal. This improvement was additionally portrayed on repeat imaging done during one of the patient's later hospitalizations (Figures 1-2).
}
{Lab tests: During her mid-20s, the patient was found to have numerous hospital admission secondary to DKA, at which time the patient was found to have erratic blood sugars (40s-500s) with an endocrinologist closely following her case. Her diabetes was being treated with both Tresiba (insulin degludec) and inhaled insulin, Afrezza. It was at this time that she was also found to have significant elevations in her liver tests, which consisted (at their highest) of an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 7,184 U/L (reference: 8-48 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 650 U/L (reference: 7-55 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 443 U/L (reference: 40-129 U/L). Physical exam demonstrated hepatomegaly, which was confirmed on CT. She continued to present to the hospital numerous times with these flares, found to have fluctuations in both her blood glucose levels and aminotransferases. Other imaging, such as an abdominal ultrasound during these times had demonstrated fatty liver with an atrophic pancreas. She also had had multiple endoscopic ultrasounds and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) that demonstrated normal common bile duct (CBD). Due to this, the patient was tested for numerous other etiologies for the cause of these findings, including autoimmune hepatitis, infectious, ischemic, and druginduced hepatitis, all being ruled out at this time. Some of these tests included a hepatitis panel, acetaminophen levels, ceruloplasmin level, alpha-1-anitrypsin level, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody just to name a few.

{Symptoms: "First sought medical attention due to the occurrence of round, xanthochromic lesions on his right knee and right elbow as shown in the following pictures. Progression of the lesions was gradual and non-traumatic." }
{Case Report: "In mid-2015, a 9-year-old boy first sought medical attention due to the occurrence of round, xanthochromic lesions on his right knee and right elbow as shown in the following pictures. Progression of the lesions was gradual and non-traumatic. Physical examination showed height: 145 cm, weight: 46 kg, body mass index (BMI): 18.62 kg/m2 . The patient presented with blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg and heart rate of 95 bpm. A multidisciplinary approach was applied with the help of a pediatrician, cardiologist, and nutritionist to reduce the total cardiovascular risk. It also included dietary recommendations and motivation for regular physical activity and psychological support to comply with the long-term treatment (4, 5). A treatment plan for the patient was prepared in accordance with the European recommendations: administration of statins in the maximum tolerated dose and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (3, 7) Initial treatment with Atorvastatin 20 mg in combination with Ezetimibe 10 mg was selected (8). With its help, the patient’s LDL level decreased by roughly 46% for 5 months; however, he developed a severe statin intolerance: muscle weakness in his lower limbs and unwillingness to exercise. Creatin phosphokinase was elevated—approximately three times higher than the upper reference value—an insignificant finding in this case. A significant increase of the hepatic enzyme (alanine aminotransferase) levels was observed: a nearly threefold rise in comparison to baseline levels. Apart from the BMI, no other cause, potentially accountable for the statin intolerance (such as hypothyroidism, low vitamin D3, or impaired kidney function) was identified. Atorvastatin was replaced with Rosuvastatin 10 mg, but the symptoms persisted. During the following year, the patient was on a treatment with Ezetimibe 10 mg only and refused to take statins, which led to an increase in the LDL-C (Figure 3). In cases of HoFH, LDL apheresis is advisable. Unfortunately, the procedure is not performed in Bulgaria due to its high cost (9). Treatment with Mipomersen or Lomitapide was considered, but it was turned down due to its high financial cost (10). We adapted an intermittent regimen for the administration of Rosuvastatin: 10 mg three times a week with a daily intake of Ezetimibe 10 mg. As a result, myalgia disappeared. The follow-up showed varying levels of LDL-C, which were far from the desired target of 5.2–11.7 mmol/l (Figure 3). According to ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidemias, genetic testing of children is required for accurate determination of the necessary level of aggressive lipid-lowering therapy (3, 4). In May 2017, a significant development of the case was brought in by genetic analysis: next-generation sequencing and CNV analysis of a dyslipidemia panel of 29 genes (with sensitivity of more than 99%) were performed at the Department of Clinical Genetics, Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands. Two pathological mutations within the LDLR gene were identified: c.1519A>G; p.(Lys507Glu) and c.2403_2406del; p.(Leu802Alafs∗ 126). These mutations had been previously identified only in France and the Netherlands in a small number of cases: 13 for the first mutation and three for the second one (11). No additional pathogenic mutations were identified in the remaining 28 genes of the dyslipidemia panel. The analysis confirmed the initial suspicion of HoFH. The condition was in its more common form: compound heterozygosity. The clinical severity of compound heterozygosity is considered almost equal to that of true homozygosity (11). Molecular genetics confirmation strengthened our patient’s determination to be more willing to accept new treatment strategies. In September 2017, the boy, already 12 years old, became eligible for treatment with PCSK9i (12–14). His case was reviewed by a National Committee, consisting of a cardiologist, a pediatrician, and an endocrinologist, and he was approved for adjuvant biweekly treatment with Evalocomab 140 mg with the consent of his parent. The first follow-up result was obtained at the beginning of February 2018 at week 4 after two administrations of the drug. No reduction in the lipid levels was found: Total cholestrol was 8.8 mmol/l, and LDL-C was 6.8 mmol/l. Follow-up results at the beginning of May 2018 (nearly 6 months after the onset of the PCSK9i therapy) showed a reduction: total cholesterol was 7.46 mmol/l (15.2% reduction), and LDL-C was 5.68 mmol/l (16.4% reduction). Treatment with PCSK9i was combined with a maximum tolerated dose of Rosuvastatin 10 mg three times a week and Ezetimibe 10 mg daily. He was able to tolerate statins daily (BMI = 24.5 kg/m2 ) due to the sufficient values of growth variables (height, weight, and BMI) characteristic for the patient’s age (12). Subsequently, the patient started taking a combined pill of 10 mg Rosuvastatin and 10 mg Ezetimibe daily along with Evalocomab 140 mg twice a week. Follow-up evaluation was performed every 6 months. LDLC follow-up showed a tendency for reaching the target levels. A positive result of LDL-C decrease by 50% in comparison with the initial values was achieved after the addition of Evalocomab to the dual lipid-lowering therapy. This was the reason why an increase in the statin dose was not necessary. Since January 2020, the target levels have been successfully preserved below 3.5 mmol/l. (14) (Figure 3). The dynamics of the different lipid profile values during the 5-year course are displayed in Figure 3. The mean reduction of LDL-C by a therapeutic approach that included Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily, Ezetimibe 10 mg daily, and Evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks led to an initial decrease in LDL-C by 41.17% during the first year. The effect increased over time, reaching 52.17% for the whole 2-year period. The effect on LDL-C for this period increased, which indirectly indicated lack of antiEvolocumab antibodies (the latter have not been tested). No effect on triglycerides and HDL-C was observed. As a result of the triple lipid-lowering therapy, significant reduction in the levels of Apolipoprotein-B was detected, reaching 29.16%. No statistically significant difference was found in Lp(a) levels (p > 0.05). Additional laboratory assays, such as complete blood biochemistry (blood glucose and HbA1c) and hematology analyses were carried out. The only ascertained increase was that of aminotransferase levels (three times the normal value) during the initiation of the daily statin intake. Subsequently, aminotransferase levels returned to normal. Each year, the patient undergoes a complete cardiological examination: electrocardiography, echocardiography, duplex sonography of the carotid arteries, and stress test. No abnormalities were detected, apart from the thickness of the communal carotid artery. During the treatment, the thickness showed no alteration. Involution of xanthomas was observed in the first year of treatment with a reduction of LDL levels by almost 50%. Skin lesions’ appearance during the 5-year period is shown on Figure 4. Side effects, including minor flu-like symptoms, were reported by the patient’s mother after the first administration of Evolocumab. An increase in the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections has been observed since the addition of the monoclonal antibody to the therapeutic scheme. During the ongoing treatment and monitoring, it was ascertained that the child had a normal growth rate and height, which was at the 50th percentile. BMI showed the following deviations: an initial increase in BMI, which was insignificant, followed by a reduction of body mass and reaching a BMI at the third percentile at the age of 15, which requires attention and subsequent follow-up (Supplementary Figure 1). Because of this fact, we planned an increase in energy intake and scheduled a consultation with a pediatric dietologist. Pubertal development was at Tanner Stage 1 at the beginning of the treatment. At the age of 15, the patient was at Tanner stage 3, which was interpreted as normal development. In January 2021, while being on a triple lipid-lowering therapy, the patient suffered a mild COVID-19 infection, which had no complications." }
{Lab tests: "No pathologic heart sounds were heard on auscultation; peripheral pulsations were within normal limits. Blood lipid analysis revealed extremely elevated total and LDL-C levels (18 and 15 mmol/l, respectively) with normal triglycerides (1.3 mmol/l) and HDL-C (1.4 mmol/l). Further laboratory tests revealed an Apolipoprotein-B/Apolipoprotein-A1 ratio of 2.9 (Apolipoprotein-B: 3.5 g/l, Apolipoprotein-A1: 1.4 g/l), which confirmed that the abovementioned lesions were xanthomas. The patient had normal thyroid function, normal vitamin D3 levels, and no jaundice or anemia. We also found high levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a): 270 mg/dl), which was measured by an immunoturbidimetric assay. Family history: The available data on the affected family members are presented in Figure 1. According to the Simon Broome criteria, the boy was classified as having a definite FH (4, 5). Based on the early age of occurrence of xanthomas, extremely elevated LDL cholesterol levels, the presence of hypercholesterolemia in both parents, and family history of premature ischemic heart disease, we concluded that the condition was in its homozygous form (4–6). Functional testing, electrocardiography at rest, and cardiopulmonary testing registered no abnormalities. Echocardiography revealed posterior annular calcification of the mitral valve and thickened and sclerotic aortic valve without any pathological gradient, normal ejection fraction (67%), and normal global longitudinal strain (−25%) (Figure 2). Additional tests for subclinical atherosclerosis were carried out in accordance with the European guidelines (7). Doppler ultrasound of the arteries of the extremities was performed by an angiologist and revealed no atherosclerotic lesions. Intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries was elevated for the patient’s age and corresponded to the values of a 30-year-old male (Figure 2)." }
